title: 'Inline'
description: 'In TypeScript, an inline type refers to a type definition declared directly at the point of use without assigning it a separate name.'

The names of GraphQL object types corresponding to TypeScript inline types are generated by excluding any non-alphanumeric characters.

<Info>For comparison, see [referenced types](/concepts/types/referenced).</Info>

## Example

```ts
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
}

@graphql.resolver()
class UserResolver {
  @graphql.query()
  getUserId(): Pick<User, 'id'> {
    // ...
  }
}
```

In this example, the return type `Pick<User, 'id'>` of the `getUserId` query is not a valid object type name.
To resolve this, non-alphanumeric characters are excluded, resulting in the generated name `PickUserid`.

```graphql
type PickUserid {
  id: String!
}

type Query {
  getUserId: PickUserid
}
```

This ensures that the generated name is compatible with the GraphQL naming requirements.
