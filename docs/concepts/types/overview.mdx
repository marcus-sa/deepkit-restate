There is no code distinction between [Object](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/object-types/) and [Input](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#input-types) types.

It depends entirely on where those types are being used in the code.

For example, TypeScript object type literals used in query/mutation parameters will be GraphQL Input types, whereas the return type of those resolvers will be GraphQL Object types.
